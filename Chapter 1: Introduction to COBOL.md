COBOL - known as "Common Business Oriented Language" is a programming language
that was developed in the late 1950s (1959) by CODASYL. 

COBOL was mainly used for business and finance but was also the result of the
effort from the U.S Department of Defense to create a programming language for processing data.

Advantages of COBOL:
 
  1. **It is easy to Understand** - COBOL is an English-like language that makes it user friendly as all commands / instructions can be coded using english words.

  2. **It is machine independent** - COBOL programs can be executed in different types of computer with slight or no modifications at all. (can be also said to other languages but ok ig)

  3. **It is easy to maintain** - between COBOL-74, it was revised only in 1985 through COBOL-85 with its lates version modified only in the late 90s, therefore a program that is easy to maintain can save a company considerate time and money.

  4. **COBOL programs are uniquely organized** - there are only 4 major parts what we need to understand when making a COBOL program that are called divisions. They are sequenced in the following order:
  Identification Division, Environment Division, Data Division, Procedure Division.

  5. **COBOL programs can handle and process large commercial data processing with only a few statements** - COBOL is able to do this by its ability of writing several program statements using its input-output operations.

  6. **Includes a PICTURE clause for detailed field specification** - it did not support local variables recorsion, dynamic Malloc, or structured programming constructs.

  7. **Has reserved words (over 400) called keywords** - the original COOBOL specification supported self-modifiying code via the infamouse "ALTER X TO PRECEED TO Y" statement and has since been removed.
